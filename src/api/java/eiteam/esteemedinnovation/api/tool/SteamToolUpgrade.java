/**
 * This interface is used to create your own upgrades for {@link SteamTool SteamTools}. Below describes how you can
 * go about creating and registering your own own upgrades.
 *
 * <h2>Creating an upgrade</h2>
 * In most cases, you will need to create a new custom object/class in order to create a new upgrade for a steam tool.
 * It must inherit the interface, {@link SteamToolUpgrade}. Sometimes, you can get
 * away with using a generic base-class that provides simple and generic implementations of all of the required
 * {@link SteamToolUpgrade} methods.
 *
 * <h3>Special behavior</h3>
 * The methods above on their own do not provide any special behavior. They simply allow the upgrade to be put into
 * tools, and provide new icon overlays and tooltip info for them. SteamToolUpgrade
 * provides a variety of {@code on*} methods for special behavior. It is recommended to simply look at the methods
 * provided by the interface to see what is possible.
 * <p>
 * The {@code on*} methods that return a boolean will cancel their according event when false is returned by any
 * upgrade, preventing any further processing. There is no ensured order in which upgrade {@code on*} methods are called.
 * <p>
 * The {@code on*} methods all get called after making sure the tool is wound up. If you don't care about that, then you
 * need your own event handler.
 *
 * <h4>Tool strength</h4>
 * There are two methods that allow the upgrade to modify the tool's strength:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link SteamToolUpgrade#getToolStrength(IBlockState, ItemStack, ItemStack)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link SteamToolUpgrade#modifiesToolStrength()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Registering an upgrade</h2>
 * The upgrade must be registered accordingly, otherwise it will not work. First, it must be registered as an
 * ordinary item. Then, it must be registered using
 * {@link ToolUpgradeRegistry#register(SteamToolUpgrade)}.
