<h4>Notices:</h4>
<p>the license of those files are the same of the mod</p>
<p>in case you dont credit yourself I will make the job but it can take one to two weeks to be done +commit aproval time so its better to credit yourself</p>
<p>if the translation got reported on the bugs session I'm not from the mod team so I cannot tell for sure but its most likely to get your translation excluded</p>
