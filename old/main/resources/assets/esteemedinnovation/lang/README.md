# Esteemed Innovation Localization Project

If you are native to any language not listed here, fork this repo and work on this branch to localize the mod for your language.

You may create new translations or work to improve existing ones. The license of those files are the same of the mod.

## Why should I contribute?
You can give people speaking your language that don't understand English very well the ability to play and understand the mod more fully.

## Credits and current languages
