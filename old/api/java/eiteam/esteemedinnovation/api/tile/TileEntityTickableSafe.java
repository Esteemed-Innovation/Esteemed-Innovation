    /**
     * Like {@link TileEntity#onLoad()}, except that it is safe (see {@link #safeUpdate()}) and happens after the world
     * has loaded. onLoad() occurs during the world loading process, so you cannot access any blockstate values or
     * anything of that sort. This is designed to be used for initialization stuff.
     * <p>
     * This is called before {@link #safeUpdate()} is called.
     * <p>
     * You must either call the supermethod or {@link #setInitialized(boolean)} in your implementation, or at some
     * point during update or safeUpdate, otherwise this method will repeatedly get called.
     * <p>
     * This is not necessarily the first update. Rather, it is the first update after the TE has been uninitialized. It
     * just happens to also begin uninitialized. It truly is called whenever an update occurs and the TE is not
     * initialized (see {@link #isInitialized()}).
     * <p>
     * For example, you might have a device that sets some value in the TE based on the block's facing value. The
     * facing value probably won't change, so it doesn't make sense to retrieve that value every update. Using this,
     * you would store the value once, and then simply use it in {@link #safeUpdate()} when you need. However, if you
     * had some custom behavior utilizing a {@link PipeWrench} that would rotate the block, you would need to reset
     * that value in the TE. You can do that by having a proxy method in the TE that calls {@link #setInitialized(boolean)}
     * (since that method is protected for security reasons; more on that later) so that the next update resets the
     * value in the TE.
     * <p>
