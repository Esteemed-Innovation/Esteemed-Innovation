Esteemed Innovation, or EI for short, is a tech mod for Minecraft based on steam power as its core. The mod includes a variety of steam tech, with upgradeable steam powered armor and tools and steam powered machinery to aid the player in a fun and innovative way.

The goal of EI is innovative content that encourages fun play rather than trying to one-up other tech mods. EI is currently in beta.
